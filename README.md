# Visual Prompt Tuning-- Ablation Studies and Improvements
Intro to deep learning (18786) project.

Based on the paper Visual Prompt Tuning [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12119) by Jia et al.

 We are making changes to the original VPT [codebase](https://github.com/kmnp/vpt)


To Do:
- [ ] Explain the limitations of the current setup within our constraints
- [ ] Try smaller models


Ablations:
-
