# Visual Prompt Tuning-- Ablation Studies and Improvements
Intro to deep learning (18786) project.

Based on the paper Visual Prompt Tuning [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12119) by Jia et al.

Ablations:
- [ ] No of layers in VPT Deep
- [ ] Prompt Placement
- [ ] VPT Performance with and without Gaussian Noise
- [ ] Transfer Learning b/w prompts of different datasets
